### Example 3: Hook Improvement

**User's Original Hook**:
> "Product management is changing because of AI. In this article, I'll discuss some ways AI affects product managers."

**Improved Options**:

**Option 1 (Data-driven)**:
> "Last month, I asked AI to analyze 500 customer interviews. It took 30 minutes instead of 3 weeks. Product management will never be the same."

**Option 2 (Question)**:
> "What if you could talk to every customer, read every review, and analyze every support ticket—all before your morning coffee?"

**Option 3 (Story)**:
> "Sarah spent two weeks building the wrong feature. Not because she didn't understand her users, but because she couldn't process the hundreds of interviews fast enough to spot the pattern."

### Example 4: Section Feedback

**User**: "Just finished my 'Common Mistakes' section. Thoughts?"

**Response**:
